# ombuds-site
The public website for Ombuds.

This site is generated via Jekyll. 
See Jekyll's [quickstart guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) for build and development instructions on your local machine.

All of the content is compiled in the `_site/` directory.
The master branch of this repository is monitored by a Digital Ocean droplet that pulls down updates to the live site every five minutes.
Those changes will be visible at https://getombuds.org


If you want to deploy changes, you must ensure that the built files in `_site/` are included in your commits and you push to the master branch.
If you do not have the priviledges to push to master, open a pull request or contact Nick and we will give you access.
