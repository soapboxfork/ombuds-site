2^0 sentence description:<br>
Ombuds inserts and retrieves public statements in the Bitcoin block chain.

2^1 sentence description:<br>
Bitcoin provides a resilient peer-to-peer network and a transparent, verifiable ledger.  The Ombuds Toolkit defines a message protocol (known as Bulletins) and provides mobile, desktop, and web clients.  Together, Ombuds provides a familiar microblog interface where Bitcoin concepts have been abstracted, yet capitalize on the advantageous properties of Bitcoin.

<p>
2^2 paragraph description:<br>
Ombuds enables any holder of Bitcoin to publish immutable statements within Bitcoin's block chain. These statements, which we call bulletins, are encoded within Bitcoin transactions which can be sent from a smartphone or a computer. These statements can be viewed from any computer that can connect to the Bitcoin network.
<br><br>
If a Bitcoin user can get a transaction into the block chain it is effectively permanent. Ombuds is based off of this principle. Any software that understands Ombuds’s messaging format and has a copy of the block chain can then decode these bulletins and display them for the public to view.
<br><br>
To censor a user's bulletins, an attacker must either block access to Bitcoin completely or generate blocks faster than the entire network. Since most small nations do not have the computing infrastructure to mount a 51% attack against the Bitcoin network, Ombuds’s method for storing bulletins is robust.
<br><br>
In essence, we have re-purposed Bitcoin as an immutable public record of free speech and we have built the tools that let anyone publish, view, and interact with these records. This system does not depend on the honesty or availability of any single website, service or hard drive. Instead, Ombuds uses the global distribution of the block chain to ensure the availability of these records.
