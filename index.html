<h2 id="how">How does it work?</h2>

<h4>A one sentence description:</h4>
<p>
We have repurposed Bitcoin as an immutable public record for free speech and we have built the tools that let anyone publish into and view that record. 
</p>

<h4>A three sentence description:</h4>
<p>
Bitcoin provides a resilient peer-to-peer network and a transparent, verifiable ledger.  
The Ombuds Toolkit defines a message format (known as bulletins) and provides mobile, desktop, and web clients that let's users interact with those messages.  
Together, this software provides a familiar microblogging service that uses Bitcoin as the medium for immutable, public statements.
</p>

<h4>A four paragraph description:</h4>
<p>
Ombuds enables any holder of Bitcoin to publish immutable statements within Bitcoin's block chain. 
These statements, which we call bulletins, are encoded within Bitcoin transactions which can be sent from a smartphone or a computer. 
These statements can be viewed from any computer that can connect to the Bitcoin network.
</p>
<p>
If a Bitcoin user can get a transaction into the block chain it is effectively permanent. 
Ombuds is based off of this principle. Any software that understands Ombuds' messaging format and has a copy of the block chain can then decode these bulletins and display them for the public to view.
</p>
<p>
To censor a user's bulletins, an attacker must either block access to Bitcoin completely or generate blocks faster than the entire honest network. 
Since most small nations do not have the hashing infrastructure to mount a 51% attack against the Bitcoin network, Ombuds's method for storing bulletins is robust.
</p>
<p>
This system does not depend on the honesty or availability of any single website, service or hard drive. 
Instead, Ombuds relies on the global distribution of the block chain to ensure the availability of its public record.

<h4>An eleven page undergraduate engineering thesis:</h4>

<p>
If you would like to dive deeper, we wrote a <a href="/research">white paper</a> about the project that you can read. 
Be aware that it was written for a technical audience in mind, so it will be dense.
However, if you already know what Bitcoin is, this paper was written for you!
